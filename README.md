# lost-and-found
 A Minecraft 1.18.1 and 1.18.2 mod to allow recovery of important items through fishing! This was a learning project for me, so the code might not be terribly good to look at, but it seems to work at this point.
 
 I'm a college student, so I might not have time to respond to issues in a timely manner, but you can report them here anyway. Also, I'll port the mod at my own pace, and am not interested in backporting or sideporting to Fabric at this time.
